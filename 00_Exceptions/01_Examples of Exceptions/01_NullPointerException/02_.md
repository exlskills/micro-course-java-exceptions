The "NullPointerException" is thrown when we compare an object to a null value. As an exercise, change the value above to stop the exception from being thrown.

Working with null values may not be the best practice because there may be situations where the "NullPointerException" is thrown by the program. The most effective way to avoid a "NullPointerException" is to check all object references before accessing one of the object's fields or methods. Use the `try{}` and `catch{}` blocks to check if the object is null.
