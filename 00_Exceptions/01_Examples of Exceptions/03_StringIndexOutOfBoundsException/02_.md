The exception occurs when the index of a value does not exist in the `String` we call. The code we examined above attempts to access the character at the thirteenth index of `exampleVariableOne`, which only has a length of twelve and a maximum index of eleven. Play around with the index number to stop the exception from occurring.

A great way to avoid this exception is to use something like `stringname.length()-1` for the last index instead of putting a specific value, which may turn out to be incorrect and cause the error. Keep in mind that the length of a `String` can change if concatenation is used. Only use specific index values if you are completely certain about the number of characters inside the `String`.
