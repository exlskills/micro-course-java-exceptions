When we attempt to find the square root of a negative number, the program returns "NaN". Contrary to exceptions, a "NaN" result will not cause your program to stop, but may still become an issue if you try to the use the "NaN" result in any other calculations in the program. For example, you will likely throw an error when "NaN", which is not a number, ends up in an expression with an `int`. Java will throw an error because arithmetic operators cannot be used on two different data types.
