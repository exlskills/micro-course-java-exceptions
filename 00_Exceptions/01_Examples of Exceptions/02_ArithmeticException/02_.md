In the scenario above, we divide by zero, which is why the "ArithmeticException" is thrown. Play around with the number you are dividing by to get the error to stop. As you can see, these errors are easily avoidable if you pay extreme attention to detail and ensure all of your expressions are mathematically correct when you code. In fact, when dealing with mathematical expressions, a logic error causes a larger problem because you will not receive an exception for it. This means you would have to sift through the code and dig up the mistake in order to resolve it. Always be very careful when writing calculations to ensure the intended result.
