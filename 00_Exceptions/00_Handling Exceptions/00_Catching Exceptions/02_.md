In the scenario above, an error is supposed to occur because we try to convert characters into integers. Instead of the error, the program caught the exception "NumberFormatException" itself, and printed out a different result specified by us beforehand.

How do we catch an exception? Set the code that might throw the error inside a `try{}` block. Then, set the code that catches and handles the exception inside a `catch{}` block. Then, when the program runs, if there is a statement inside the `try{}` block that throws a "NumberFormatException", it causes the `catch{}` block to execute, causing the leftover statements in the `try{}` block to remain unexecuted. Remember that the `catch{}` block is executed only if the exception thrown in the `try{}` block matches the exception inside the parentheses of the `catch{}` block.
