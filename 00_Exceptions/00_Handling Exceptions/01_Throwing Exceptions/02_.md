The program above throws the "ArithmeticException" if one of the parameters are zero as adding nothing defeats the purpose of using the `add()` method. The exception can either be handled with a `catch{}` block or thrown to the user as an exception error.

When you have one exception you need to throw, use the following syntax, `throw new ExceptionName(description)`, where "ExceptionName" has to match one of the exceptions that are already defined in Java. If you are throwing two or more exceptions, you can use the word `throws` in the method header and list out the exception names with commas separating them. The program above is an example of how you can throw exceptions in the method header.
