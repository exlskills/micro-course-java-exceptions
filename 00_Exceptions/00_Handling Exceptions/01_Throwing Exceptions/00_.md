We examined scenarios where our own code throws errors and are familiar with the exceptions that are generally defined in Java. But have you thought about possible reasons you would want to create your own exceptions? Why, you ask?

For example, when users are utilizing your program and entering data into it, for instance their name, if they enter numbers or symbols into a name field, would you want that user to get an error specifically for that field in your program letting them know they must use characters? This is why programmers in Java are able to throw exceptions with error messages that are specific to their individual programs. Let's see an example below.
